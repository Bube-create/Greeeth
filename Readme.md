## GREETH Project
A platform that allows people to plant a tree using blockchain to mitigate CO2 emissions

## THE ISSUE
Greenhouse gases pose severe environmental and health issues. They cause climate change by trapping heat, which affects various species, humans, and the environment. CO2 is a major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere with a high record of 36.7 billion metric tons. The climate change caused by carbon emissions also contributes to extreme weather, wildfires, droughts, and food shortage.

## THE SOLUTION
A platform that allows people to plant a tree which will be geo-tagged and registered on the blockchain which is viewable in a 3D-Simulated environment.
